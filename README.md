##	Introduction 

The aim of this project is to help users to use the RAK Raspberry Pi Developer Gateway more easily. The User Guide can be get from our Web(https://docs.rakwireless.com/Introduction/).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EDITED for work with Pine64 Gateway - work in progress will add information as helpful/necessary *** -RTP

### Pine64 Gateway Setup

# NOTE: YOU CAN FIND A READY TO USE ALL IN ONE CHIRPSTACK + PINEDIO GATEWAY HARDWARE ENABLED + TTN IMAGE DOWNLOAD AT TOP OF THIS README TO SAVE SETUP. :)

General Steps:

## REQUIREMENTS:

*** LoRa  + GPS antenna (preferably outside or antenna by the window- without GPS it will not show up on TTN); 
***Very Important*** to have antennas connected before attempting to setup or you could DAMAGE your Gateway ***

1.) Download SOPINE/LTS distribution of choice (Armbian used in example below)
For Pine64 Gateway select a SOPINE/LTS compatible

2.) After installing an LTS/SOPINE compatible image to sdcard/emmc, boot up and clone this fork by issuing:

clone https://github.com/RightToPrivacy/rak_common_for_gateway.git

3.) Now issue: sudo armbian-config -> System -> Hardware and enable 'i2c0', 'spi-spidev', 'uart2' (Concentrator/GPS/Temp sensor)

4.) Then go 'back' to edit BootEnv (or edit file /boot/armbianEnv.txt). Add this line in it (make sure it exists): param_spidev_spi_bus=0
    Additionall ensure it now has 'overlays=i2c0 spi-spidev uart2' (without quotes) on a single line (in BootEnv or /boot/armbianEnv.txt. Both = same location)

5.) Reboot for changes to take effect.  

6.) cd into your cloned rak_common_for_gateway directory (cloned from this fork from step #2)

7.) Follow rak_common_for_gateway instructions

8.) After installing everything open the command: sudo gateway-config

9.) inside gateway-config go to packet forwarder config editing

- Verify SPI device (concentrator) says /dev/spidev0.0 (installation of option #7 (Pine64 Gateway) should have set this for you)

- Verify GPS device is /dev/ttyS2 (installation of option #7 (Pine64 Gateway) should have set this for you)

- Save the Packet Forwarder config

10) Change the LoRa channel config to either TTN (thethingsnetwork) OR for Chirpstack, select other server

11.) Select your country's LoRa location/frequency

12.) Restart Packet Forwarder and quit

13.) Check the status by viewing journalctl or systemctl status ttn-gateway; if not active, check journalctl to see what failed, and reason for failure.

14.) Once GPS registers reliable signal (usually a few min after starting) you should see your Gateway on TTN map and tcpdump|grep 1700 should show valid radius packets. 

You should also see the Gateway version + EUI and other information on starting the concentrator, without any errors.. If you see errors, check troubleshooting below. I have examples of journalctl log at:
https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=13682&highlight=pinedio

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

If you chose Chirpstack you may enter the web interface by viewing: http://gatewayIPaddress:8080

DEFAULT CREDENTIALS (FOR CHIRPSTACK):

Login: admin

password: admin


[ will edit more please check back and feel free to add/fix anything that you notice to help us get Pine64 Gateway running properly! :) ]

***TROUBLESHOOTING:

The Things Network Gateway Systemd Commands (SSH/Shell access):
Check the status of ttn-gateway (if selecting The Things Network Channel) service by issuing:
systemctl status ttn-gateway
Restart TTN Gateway:
systemctl restart ttn-gateway
Stop TTN Gateway:
systemctl stop ttn-gateway
Start TTN Gateway:
systemctl start ttn-gateway

Check gateway version/ID
gateway-version

Find gateway EUI (run only after installing/setting up gateway numbered steps above):
journalctl | grep EUI

Configuration:
sudo gateway-config

***Gateway failed to start concentrator? 
- Check packet forwarder config to ensure device location is correct: sudo gateway-config ---> edit packet-forwarder config 
* Ensure the SX120x_conf location in packet-forwarder config matches:

        "com_type": "SPI",
        "com_path": "/dev/spidev0.0",
	
* Ensure GPS matches /dev/ttyS2:
	
        "gps_tty_path": "/dev/ttyS2",

(anytime you edit packet-forwarder config, make sure to then restart packet forwarder)

***GPS not registering location? 
- Consider running GPS antenna closer to a window (if indoors). GPS needs a direct line of sight. To test out GPS try looking at gpsmon or cat /dev/ttyS2
(ensuring GPS functions before expecting gateway to read it is recommended)

- See if you have GPS location information by running: cat /dev/ttyS2 or gpsmon (thanks JF for mentioning this- helped me)

If you have more tips/troubleshooting/information, please do send: either as an issue, fork, mod. Or optionally email: righttoprivacy[at]tutanota.com

Thanks! :)
